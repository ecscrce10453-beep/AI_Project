# AI-Based Unit Test Generator — Mini Project

## Abstract
This project implements an AI-driven unit test generator using LLMs. The system takes Python code and produces corresponding pytest test cases using either a local transformer model or OpenAI API.

## Relevance to Research Paper
The research paper discusses LLM-based test generation as a major trend in AI-driven software testing. This project directly implements an LLM-powered test generation agent, matching the paper’s taxonomy and methodology.

## Architecture
1. Input module (Streamlit UI)
2. LLM module (OpenAI / Local Transformer)
3. Test file generator
4. PyTest executor
5. Output report

## Results
The system successfully generated and executed tests for sample programs, demonstrating AI’s capability in automated testing.

## Conclusion
This project validates that LLMs can automate test creation efficiently, supporting the themes of the research paper.
